                <h1>WHAT IS HTML5 ?</h1>

                <p>HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is
                    the fifth and final major HTML version that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation. The
                    current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard. It is maintained by the Web Hypertext
                    Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), a consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple,
                    Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft).</p>
                <p>
                    HTML5 was first released in a public-facing form on 22 January 2008, with a major update and "W3C
                    Recommendation" status in October 2014. Its goals were to improve the language with support for the
                    latest multimedia and other new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and
                    consistently understood by computers and devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc., without
                    XHTML's rigidity; and to remain backward-compatible with older software. HTML5 is intended to
                    subsume not only HTML 4 but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.
                </p>

                <p>
                    HTML5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations; it
                    extends, improves, and rationalizes the markup available for documents and introduces markup and
                    application programming interfaces (APIs) for complex web applications. For the same reasons, HTML5
                    is also a candidate for cross-platform mobile applications because it includes features designed
                    with low-powered devices in mind.

                </p>

                <p>
                    Many new syntactic features are included. To natively include and handle multimedia and graphical
                    content, the new &lt;video&gt;, &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;canvas&gt; elements were added, expandable
                    sections are natively implemented through &lt;summary&gt;...&lt;/summary&gt; and
                    &lt;details&gt;...&lt;/details&gt; rather than depending on CSS or JavaScript, and support for
                    scalable vector graphics (SVG) content and MathML for mathematical formulas was also added. To
                    enrich the semantic content of documents, new page structure elements such as &lt;main&gt;,
                    &lt;section&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;aside&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, and
                    &lt;figure&gt; are added. New attributes were introduced, some elements and attributes were removed,
                    and others such as &lt;a&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;, and &lt;menu&gt; were changed, redefined, or
                    standardized. The APIs and Document Object Model (DOM) are now fundamental parts of the HTML5
                    specification, and HTML5 also better defines the processing for any invalid documents.
                </p>
                <h1>History</h1>

                <p>
                    The Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) began work on the new standard in
                    2004. At that time, HTML 4.01 had not been updated since 2000, and the World Wide Web Consortium
                    (W3C) was focusing future developments on XHTML 2.0. In 2009, the W3C allowed the XHTML 2.0 Working
                    Group's charter to expire and decided not to renew it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Mozilla Foundation and Opera Software presented a position paper at a World Wide Web Consortium
                    (W3C) workshop in June 2004, focusing on developing technologies that are backward-compatible with
                    existing browsers, including an initial draft specification of Web Forms 2.0. The workshop concluded
                    with a vote—8 for, 14 against—for continuing work on HTML. Immediately after the workshop, WHATWG
                    was formed to start work based upon that position paper, and a second draft, Web Applications 1.0,
                    was also announced. The two specifications were later merged to form HTML5. The HTML5 specification
                    was adopted as the starting point of the work of the new HTML working group of the W3C in 2007.
                </p>

                <p>
                    WHATWG's Ian Hickson (Google) and David Hyatt (Apple) produced W3C's first public working draft of
                    the specification on 22 January 2008.
                </p>

                <h1>FEATURES</h1>

                <p>HTML5 is the fifth and latest version of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), the standard language
                    used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. HTML5 was developed with the goal
                    of improving web functionality, making it more efficient, and better suited for modern web
                    applications. Here are the key features of HTML5:</p>

                <p><strong>1.Semantic Elements:</strong> HTML5 introduced several semantic elements that provide a more
                    meaningful
                    structure to web pages. These elements describe the content they contain, making it easier for
                    search engines and assistive technologies to understand and process the page. Some examples of
                    semantic elements are `&lt;header&gt;`, `&lt;nav&gt;`, `&lt;article&gt;`, `&lt;section&gt;`,
                    `&lt;aside&gt;`, `&lt;footer&gt;`, and more.</p>

                <p><strong>2.Audio and Video Support:</strong> HTML5 introduced the `&lt;audio&gt;` and `&lt;video&gt;`
                    elements,
                    enabling native support for embedding audio and video content directly into web pages without the
                    need for third-party plugins like Flash. It supports various audio and video formats, making it
                    easier to provide multimedia content on the web.</p>

                <p><strong>3.Canvas:</strong> The `&lt;canvas&gt;` element allows dynamic, scriptable rendering of 2D
                    graphics and
                    animations. It provides a powerful API for drawing shapes, images, and text, making it popular for
                    creating interactive games and visualizations directly within the web browser.</p>

                <p><strong>4.SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics):</strong> HTML5 brought native support for SVG, which is an
                    XML-based
                    format for describing vector graphics. SVG allows for high-quality resolution-independent graphics
                    that can be easily animated and manipulated using CSS and JavaScript.</p>

                <p><strong>5.Geolocation:</strong> HTML5 introduced the Geolocation API, which enables web applications
                    to access a
                    user's geographical location (with user permission). This feature allows for location-based
                    services, mapping applications, and more.</p>

                <p><strong>6.Local Storage:</strong> HTML5 provides the `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` APIs, which
                    allow web
                    applications to store data locally on the client-side. This local storage capability enables
                    developers to create offline-capable web applications and improve performance by reducing server
                    requests.</p>

                <p><strong>7.Web Workers:</strong> HTML5 introduced Web Workers, which allow JavaScript code to run in
                    the
                    background on separate threads. This feature enables developers to perform intensive tasks without
                    affecting the main UI thread, resulting in a more responsive user experience.</p>

                <p><strong>8.Web Sockets:</strong> Web Sockets offer bidirectional communication channels over a single
                    TCP
                    connection, allowing real-time data exchange between the client and server. This technology is
                    commonly used in online gaming, chat applications, and other real-time applications.</p>

                <p><strong>9.Form Enhancements:</strong> HTML5 introduced several form input types and attributes that
                    improve user
                    experience and reduce the need for JavaScript-based solutions. Examples include `type="email"`,
                    `type="date"`, `required`, `placeholder`, and more.</p>

                <p><strong>10.Drag and Drop:</strong> HTML5 introduced native support for drag-and-drop functionality,
                    making it
                    easier for users to interact with and move elements on a web page.</p>

                <p><strong>11.Responsive Design:</strong> While not a specific HTML5 feature, HTML5 has been designed
                    with
                    responsive web design principles in mind. This means that it is easier to create web pages that
                    adapt to different screen sizes and devices, providing a better user experience across various
                    platforms.</p>

                <p> Overall, HTML5 has revolutionized web development by introducing new features that make the web more
                    interactive, dynamic, and accessible while reducing the reliance on external plugins and
                    technologies. As a result, HTML5 has become the standard for building modern web applications and
                    content on the internet.</p>
