It seems you are referring to formatting tags in HTML. However, many of the traditional formatting tags have been deprecated in favor of using CSS for styling purposes. Nevertheless, I will explain some of the traditional formatting tags and their uses. Keep in mind that it is generally recommended to use CSS for styling whenever possible.

1. &lt;b&gt; and &lt;strong&gt; Tags:
    The &lt;b&gt; tag and &lt;strong&gt; tag were traditionally used to apply bold formatting to text. The &lt;strong&gt; tag carries more semantic meaning, indicating strong importance, while the &lt;b&gt; tag is used more for stylistic purposes.
    Usage: &lt;b&gt; and &lt;strong&gt; tags are used to make text bold, but it's better to use CSS (fontweight: bold) for styling purposes, and use the &lt;strong&gt; tag when emphasizing important content for screen readers and search engines.

   Example:
   html
   &lt;p&gt;This is &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;important&lt;/strong&gt; text.&lt;/p&gt;
   

2. &lt;i&gt; and &lt;em&gt; Tags:
    The &lt;i&gt; tag and &lt;em&gt; tag were traditionally used to apply italic formatting to text. The &lt;em&gt; tag carries more semantic meaning, indicating emphasis, while the &lt;i&gt; tag is used more for stylistic purposes.
    Usage: Like bold formatting, it is better to use CSS (fontstyle: italic) for italic text, and use the &lt;em&gt; tag for emphasizing content that is important for screen readers and search engines.

   Example:
   html
   &lt;p&gt;This is &lt;i&gt;italic&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;em&gt;emphasized&lt;/em&gt; text.&lt;/p&gt;
   

3. &lt;u&gt; Tag:
    The &lt;u&gt; tag was used to underline text. However, underlining text is no longer recommended for general content because underlines are often associated with hyperlinks. Instead, use CSS to style text decorations, like underlines.

   Example (Not Recommended):
   html
   &lt;p&gt;This is &lt;u&gt;underlined&lt;/u&gt; text.&lt;/p&gt;
   

4. &lt;s&gt; and &lt;del&gt; Tags:
    The &lt;s&gt; tag and &lt;del&gt; tag were used to apply a strikethrough effect to text. The &lt;del&gt; tag carries semantic meaning, indicating deleted text or changes, while the &lt;s&gt; tag was used for stylistic purposes.
    Usage: For strikethrough text, it's better to use CSS (textdecoration: linethrough), and if the content is indicating deleted text or changes, use the &lt;del&gt; tag for semantic purposes.

   Example:
   html
   &lt;p&gt;This is &lt;s&gt;strikethrough&lt;/s&gt; and &lt;del&gt;deleted&lt;/del&gt; text.&lt;/p&gt;
   

While some of these traditional formatting tags are still supported in modern browsers, their use is generally discouraged in favor of CSS for better separation of concerns and to enhance the semantic meaning of the content. Instead of using formatting tags for styling, focus on using CSS to style your HTML content.
